# It is Even

## Description
This program asks the user to enter a number and checks whether it is **even** or **odd**.  
It uses the modulus operator (`%`) to determine if the number is divisible by 2.  
The program also demonstrates how to use conditionals and a function that returns a value.

## How it run
1.- Open the terminal in VS Code.  
2.- Copile the program:

g++ IsItEven.cpp -o IsItEven  
3.- Execute:  
- On Windows  
.\ItIsEven.exe  
- On MacOS/ Linux  
./ItIsEven

## What I learned
- I learned how to use the modulus operator `%` to test divisibility.
- I undertood how to use conditionals (`if` / `else`) effectively.
- How to created a **`function` that return a value**.
- The difference between **even** and **odd** numbers in mathematical logic.
- How to display clear **feedback messages** for the user.
- How to write simple, clean, and well- commented C++ code.

## Academic Integrity Note
I use ChatGPT to study and understand the task requirements.  
After learning the concepts, I adapted and wrote the **final version** of the code myself.
