# Biography

## Descrption 
This program stores, and prints basic personal information such as **name**, **hometown**, and **age**.  
Each value is stored in a variable.  
The output of the program depends on the information you stored in the variables.  
We could also modify the code to ask the user for input, but in this case the values are entered directly into the variables.

## How to run 
1.- Open the terminal in VS Code.  
2.- Compile the program:

g++ Biography.cpp -o Biography   
3.- Execute:
- On Windows  
.\Biography.exe  
- On MacOS/ Linux  
./Biography

## What I learned
- How to use `string` and `int` variables.
- How to use `getline()` for reading strings with spaces, such as full name.
- How to use `while` loop to continuously ask for valid unput.
- How to print multiples lines using one `cout` statement.
- How to manage `numeric and string inputs` together.
- How to use `cin. ignore()` to clear leftover newline characters after reading integers.

## Academic Integrity Note
I used ChatGPT to study and understand the task requirements.  
After learning the concepts, I adapted and wrote the **final version** of the code myself.
