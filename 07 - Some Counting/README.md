# Some Counting 

## Description
This program demostrates different types of **for-loops** by printing sequences of numbers using various starting points, ending points, and step values.  
Each loop shows a common counting pattern, such as counting up, counting down, and skipping numbers with custom increments or decrements.    
The purpose of this exercise is to practise controlling loop behaviour in C++ and printing numerical sequences to the console.  

## How to run 
1.- Open the terminal in VS Code.  
2.- Compile the program:

g++ SomeCounting.cpp -o SomeCounting  
3.- Execute:
- On Windows  
.\SomeCounting.exe
- On MacOS/ Linux  
./SomeCounting

## What I learned
- How to use `for loop structure` in C++.
- How to control the **start value, end value, and increment/ decrement** of a loop.
- How to create loops that **count up** and loops that **count down.**
- How to different **step values** (such as +1, -1, +5, -2).
- How to print a full sequence of numbers to the console.
- How to organise multiple loops in the same program.

## Academic Integrity Note
I use ChatGPT to study and understand the task requirements.  
After learning the concepts, I adapted and wrote the **final version** of the code myself.
