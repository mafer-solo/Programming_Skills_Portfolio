# Coding Is Cool

 ## Description
The mean purpose of the program is to display a simple message **"Coding is cool"** to the screen.
It also helps undertand the basic structure of a C++ program, including headers, the `main()` funtion and output using `cout` statement.
The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar with the process of writing, compiling, and executing a C++ program.

## How to execute
1.- Open terminal in VS Code.

2.- Compile de program:

g++CodingIsCool.cpp -o CodingIsCool.

3.- Execute:

./CodingIsCool

## What I learned
- How to write the simplest valid C++ program using the `main()` funtion.
- How to use the **iostream** library and the `cout` command for text output.
- The difference between **source files** `(.cpp)` and **executables**.
- How to compile of syntax, semicolons, and debugging copiler errors.
