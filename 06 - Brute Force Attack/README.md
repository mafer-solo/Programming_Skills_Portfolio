# Brute Force Attack

## Description
This program simulates a brute-force password attempt system.    
The correct password is **"12345"**, and the user has up to **% attempts** to guess it.
The program uses the **while loop** to repeat password attempts until the correct password is entered or the maximum number of attempts is reached.  
If the user enters the correct password, the program displays a welcome message:
**"Acess granted! Welcome to the Security Area. "** 
If the user fails **5 times**, the loop ends and the program warns the authorities have been alerted.  
This exercise helps practice loops, conditions, counters, and simple security logic in C++. 

## How to run
1.- Open the terminal in the VS Code.    
2.- Compile the program:

g++ BruteForceAttack.cpp -o BruteForceAttack  
3.- Execute:  
- On Windows    
.\BruteForceAttack.exe  
- On MacOS/ Linux    
./BruceForceAttack

## What I learned
- How to define a **constant password** and compare it with user input.
- How to use a **while loop** to repeat a actions until a condition is true.
- How to use **boolean variabls** to track access status (true or false).
- How to implement a **counter** to count failed attempts.
- How to stop the loop after a fixed number of tries.
- How to give **user feedback** after each input.
- How to structure **security-style logic** in C++.

## Academic Integrity Note
I use ChatGPT to study and understand the task requirements.  
After learning the concepts, I adapted and wrote the **final version** of the code myself.
