# Simple Search

## Description
This program stores a list of names inside a string array and searches for a specific name using a **for-loop**.  
The `array` contains the names: **"Jake", "Zac", "Ian", "Ron", "Sam", "Dave"**.  
The program asks the user to enter a name to search for, then loops through the array and checks each position.   
If the name is found, the program prints the index where it appears.    
If the name is not found, the program prints an error message.    
This exercise helps practise arrays, loops, user input, and simple search algorithms in C++.

## How to run
1.- Open in terminal in VS Code.  
2.- Compile the program:

g++ SimpleSearch.cpp -o SimpleSearch  
3.- Execute:
- On Windows  
.\SimpleSearch.exe  
- On MacOS/ Linux  
./SimpleSearch

## What I learned 
- How to create and initialise a **string array** in C++.
- How to loop through an array using a **`for` loop**
- How to compare **string values** inside a loop.
- How to **return** and use an **index value** from a function.
- How to search from a list using a simple search algorithm.
- How to handle cases where the search term **is found** or **is not found**.
- How to let the user enter the name to search for (optional requierement).

## Academic Integrity Note
I use ChatGPT to study and understand the task requirements.  
After learning the concepts, I adapted and wrote the **final version** of the code myself.
