# Days of the Month

## Description
This program asks the user to enter a month number (`1-12`) using the **switch statement**.  
The user enters a month number, and the program selects the correct case and print whether the month has **31 days, 30  days, or 28 days** (FEbruary, without leap-year handling).  
It  helps practice user input, conditional branching with switch, and organising cases that share the same output.

## How to run
1.- Open the terminal in VS Code.  
2.- Compile the proggram:

g++ DaysOfTheMonth.cpp -o DaysOfTheMonth  
3.- Execute:
- On Windowns  
.\DaysOfTheMonth.exe  
- On MacOS/ Linux  
./DaysOfTheMonth

## What I learned
- How to use the **`Switch statement`** to handle multiple conditions.
- How to group several `case values` that produce the same output.
- How to ask the user for numeric input using `cin`.
- How to display different results based on the month entered.
- How to handle invalid input using the default case.
- How to organise code clearly using comments for each case group.

## Academic Integrity Note
I use ChatGPT to study and understand the task requirements.  
After learning the concepts, I adapted and wrote the **final version** of the code myself.
