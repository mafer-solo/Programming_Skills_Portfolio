# 04 Primitive Quiz

## Description
This program asks the user two questions about European capital cities and compares their answers with the correct ones.  
It uses **string input**, **case-insensitive comparison**, and **conditional statements** to check whether the user's answers are correct.  
The purpose of this exercise is to practice user interaction, string handling,comparison logic, and displaying feedback messages in C++.

## How to run
1.- Open the terminal in VS Code.  
2.- Compile the program:

g++ PrimitiveQuiz.cpp -o PrimitiveQuiz  
3.- Execute:
- On Windows  
.\PrimitiveQuiz.exe

./PrimitiveQuiz

## What I learned 
- How to **use `string1` variables** to store user input.
- How to compare user answers with the correct response.
- How to read full answers using **`getline()`**.
- How to check conditions using **`if`** and **`else`**.
- How to convert strings to **lovercase** to allow fexible answers (e.g, Paris, PARIS, PaRis).
- How to display **"Correct"** or **"Incorrect"** messages.
- How to add **additional quiz questions** to improve the program.
- How to use **score counter** to track correct answers.

## Academic Integrity Note
I use ChatGPT to study and understand the task requirements.  
After learning the concepts, I adapted and wrote the **final version** of the code myself.
