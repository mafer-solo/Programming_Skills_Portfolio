# Simple Sums

## Description
This program declares two integer variables **(8 and 10)** adds them together, and prints the result to the console using the `cout` statement.  
It helps practice using **variable declaration**, initialization, arithmetic operations, and writing clear output messages in C++.  
The purpose of this exercise is to understand how to perform calculations directly inside the code and display the result.

## How to run.
1.- Open the terminal in VS Code.  
2.- Compile the program:

g++ SimpleSums.cpp -o SimpleSums
3.- Execute:
- On Windows  
.\SimpleSums.exe
- On MacOs/ Linux  
./SimpleSums

## What I learned
- How to **declare and integer variables**.
- How to perform **arithmetic operations** (addition).
- How to store results in a third variable.
- How to display a clear output message using multiple cout elements.
- How to structrure a basic C++ program with comments in each step.

## Academic Integrity Note
I use ChatGPT to study and understand that task requirements.  
After learning the concepts, I adapted and wrote the **finalversion** of the code myself.
